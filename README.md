# Why Neuropod ? 
- Build a single metrics pipeline for a problem
- Easily compare models solving the same problem (even if they're in different frameworks)
- Build optimized inference code that can run any model that solves a particular problem
- Swap out models that solve the same problem at runtime with no code change (even if the models are from different frameworks)
- Run fast experiments
